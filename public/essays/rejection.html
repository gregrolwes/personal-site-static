                    Everyone, at one time or another, experiences the emotional rollercoaster of being 
                    vulnerable. Initially, you're hesitant. You know you want that job or that date or 
                    to entertain that crowd, but those voices are always there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Don't do it. Stay safe. You're comfortable here in your shell."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, we're lucky enough to question those voices. Sometimes, we want it 
                    more than we fear embarrassment, or at least we think we do. We take the leap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a brief moment, you're freefalling. Like the drop of a rollercoaster, it's 
                    an exhilarating rush of joy and fear and everything that makes living worthwhile. 
                    You feel the high of rolling the dice, uncertain where they'll fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly, dice stop rolling, and they're not in your favor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In an instant, the entire experience comes plummeting down as you crash into your 
                    self-doubt eagerly awaiting your fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I told you so."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You're not good enough."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Fucking fool."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You're nothing. An insignificant hunk of flesh."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You couldn't do it, and you never will. You'll never be who you want to be." 
                    It stings. It cuts deep into the human heart. This isn't sadness. 
                    It's loss. Like the loss of a loved one, it's a loss of dreams. Of a future 
                    projection of yourself that you had chosen. You could have played it safe, but 
                    you saw a better day ahead and you reached for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now it's gone. That dream of what tomorrow could be is shattered into a million 
                    pieces on the floor. This is rejection. And it's the fucking devil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rejection literally does sting. The feeling of rejection or social exclusion looks 
                    incredibly similar neurologically to the feeling of physical pain. Furthermore, those 
                    who are more sensitive to physical pain are also more sensitive to the pain of 
                    rejection. This has been hardwired into our DNA. As a species that demands social 
                    acceptance for survival, we've evolved physical feedback for when we are not able 
                    to satisfy our social needs. So if the pain of rejection is instrumental to who we 
                    are as humans, how do we avoid it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For many of us, rejection is the admission price to success. Just as an athlete endures 
                    the physical pain of workouts, the ambitious must endure the pain of rejection time and 
                    time again. It doesn't get easier, it could honestly get worse. There's no comfort in 
                    this, just pain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no silver lining to rejection. No positive spin we can tell ourselves so that 
                    we sleep soundly. Rejection is suffering, but it is the price of ambition. Some will 
                    pay that price and succeed; others will never know anything but loss.

                    “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, 
                    or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man 
                    who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who 
                    strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no 
                    effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who 
                    knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who
                     at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if 
                     he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with 
                     those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” -Theodore Roosevelt
